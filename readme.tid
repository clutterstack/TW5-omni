@@background: #ffdd66;font-weight:bold;This is a plugin I wrote for myself, and it has not been extensively tested. It may also change. Back up your data, and use at your own risk!@@

The Omni (short for omnibus) plugin is meant to make it easier to collect and organise related bits of information or writing. Demo: https://clutterstack.github.io/TW5-omni/

It depends on my Quick plugin (https://github.com/clutterstack/TW5-quick) for adding tiddlers in-line. 

The Relink plugin (https://github.com/flibbles/tw5-relink) by Cameron Fischer is highly recommended at this time.
